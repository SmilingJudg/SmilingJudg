My name is Ukaibe Emelda Promise aka SmilingJudge. As a product designer in my team. I contributed to the creation of the Style guide ( Iconography to be precise as I was assigned) I also created our team 108 (Logo)

and the arrangements and tiding of the figma work space before the first presentation. And after the first presentation, I was assigned to design 2 pages/Screen: "Terms & Conditions of usage of DataSYNC website and the FAQs (Frequently asked Questions)" to enable users of DataSYNC acquiant themselves with the do and don't of DataSYNC usage as well as get answers to questions they may likely wish to know as they log into the website for easy navigation.
So I have been able to put up the wireframe, Lo-fi (https://www.figma.com/file/Ie8A81XMRsHiodqFwaeTO8)
and Hi-fidelity of these two pages.

Waiting for any other assigned task after the final presentation for finishing touches.
